# Getting Started With React

The React UI framework from Facebook allows us to make reactive user interface components that render in the browser or on the server. You can create components using a combination of html markup and JavaScript by using something called JSX. In this class you'll get a tour of the React framework by building a simple comment system. The tutorial is similar to the one found on the official React tutorial page with a few differences. First, you'll be building the comment system using ES6 ("Harmony"), the next major release of JavaScript. I'll also carefully explain each of the critical concepts as we build each component and add features.
